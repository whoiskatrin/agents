${JSON.stringify(board, null, 2)}

Game rules and context:
- You are playing against ${player}
- Empty cells are null, X's are "X", O's are "O"
- Board positions are [row, col] from 0-2
- You need to respond with a single move as [row, col]
- Winning patterns: 3 in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally

Strategic priorities (in order):
1. If you can win in one move, take it
2. If opponent can win in one move, block it
3. If center is open, take it
4. If you can create a fork (two potential winning moves), do it
5. If opponent can create a fork next turn, block it
6. Take a corner if available
7. Take any edge

Analyze the board carefully and make the optimal move following these priorities.
Return only the [row, col] coordinates for your chosen move.`,
